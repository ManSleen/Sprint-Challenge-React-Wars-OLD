1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    - **React is a library built by Facebook to build reusable UI components and manage complex state. It gives us a fast/performant way to maniulate the DOM without using querySelectors or getElementby methods.**

2)  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    - **"Thinking in React" involves the thought process of breaking our application down into separated components. We have to look at our information architecture and think about how each piece of our application will interact with each other, if they'll need to manage their own state, etc.**

3)  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    - **One main difference between Class and Functional components is that we use different syntax to create each of them. Another big difference is that you cannot use setState() in a functional component; this is why a functional component is called "stateless".**

4)  Describe state.

    - **State refers to the data that our components will have access to. We can pass this state around for our components to use.**

5)  Describe props.

    - **Props aka "properties" are like attributes that we can use in our JSX and they are immutable aka read-only. They are objects that we can consume as parameters inside functional components.**
